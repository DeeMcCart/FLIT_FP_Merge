## About
---------
Financial Planner is a system which aims at adults in Ireland who wish to improve their financial literacy, keep up to date, and access resources to **empower** financial decision making.

Ireland is recognised as having a low level of adult financial literacy by International standards.  The Department of Finance has recently (August 2023) launched an initiative to address this problem, commencing with a survey of practitioners Sept 2023.

 Ths FinancialPlanner app is suggested as a resource which could quickly be made available and accessible to a large population.  This first version includes Ireland-specific content, and thereby addresses a knowledge gap, which is not covered in more generic systems. 
<br>
In conducting a survey of the resources available online to Irish users, it was noted that there are multiple sites exist which address elements of financial planning, but a limited offering for whole-of-life planning, from cradle to grave.
<br>
Lots of individual useful websites but you need to work hard to link together the information.
Difficult to get information specifically dealing with Irish government revenue and rules.
<br>
Ideally, the site goals were to include:
* life stage-themed links to useful information
* content and theme management
* ability for users to personalise their site experience by marking resources (articles and links) of interest as favourites, which are highlighted on their return (similar to bookmarks)
* would absolutely love to have a game which takes the user from age 0 to their resting age and allows them to visualise the consequences of financial decisions
   
### Responsiveness
The site is built, with the help of Bootstrap 5, to be fully responsive so it can be used on a range of devices.

## Project Goals
----------------
1. To provide a portal for financial education content. 
2. Initially loaded with information relevant to the republic of Ireland.
3. Can be Organised into themes (life Stages) defined by an adminstrator.
4. Can allow content to be stored and classified including links, videos.
5. Where the user can tag items of interest/ further refernce.   
6. Which uses the capabilities of Django, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
7. And is accessible, responsive and relevant.
  
### UX Design Strategy
Focus is on accessible content, for the naive or more sophisticated user.
And abilty for the user to pickup content which is relevant to their needs.


### UX Design Strategy Analysis of Competitors
Competitor/ similar site analysis was undertaken over a two-week period during September 2023 to analyse existing financial literacy education schemes and information resources, the target audience for same, and to identify gaps which might provide opportunities for a new solution.

The survey details are here:

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15TBSmjT5cqSam1WWOrpNzkS8IpQ4hAMv8d7IEk12FX8/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">Google sheet - competitor analysis</a>

Based on analysing what was available it was found that, there are lots of informational, authoritative resources in Ireland and some very good government sites (such as Revenue, CCPC, citizens information, pensions authority).  These sites, however, are text-heavy and sometimes difficult to cross-reference.  A good understanding of complex english is needed to navigate the content.

There are also a lot of opinion-based or payment-required portals, and these can be hard to distinguish.

Overall, existing sites seem to be lacking in process-flows and graphical content. 

### UX Design Strategy Target Audience
This **first** release of the Financial Planner portal is aimed at:

a. Individuals (rather than companies or organisations)
b. Who have financial agency (decision-making capacity)
c. who reside or operate within the financial and legal boundaries of the Republic of Ireland (as financial content is specific to this territory)
d. who are at various adult life stages (18 -> end of life) 
e. who have internet access and the capacity to navigate a website
f. with the ability to read engish-language content (some of the content may be translatable e.g. using Google translate, but this cannot be assumed or taken for granted)
g. who wish to understand what financial information is relevant and important to a particular life stage/event.

## UX Design Scope
----------------
### Financial_Planner site Ethos & Values:
* Integrity: - <br>
Commencing an Internet search for Financial Planning advice, is akin to entering a tropical sea infested with sharks.  For the unwary, vulnerable or less knowledgable user, exposing their personal details (by initiating tracked searches on cookie-infested sites, searching for particular information or creating a user account) can have the same effect as bloodletting into the shark-infested waters, attracting predators who seek to target and exploit vulnerabilities.  When seeking information, it can be difficult to differentiate between opinions and fact.<br>
More sophisticated users can be fearful of exposure to these sharks, and more vulnerable users may avoid information seeking due to fear.

### Financial_Planner site authenticity - <br>
Acting as a trusted source that offers reliable information to users - is paramount.  Financial_Planner must be a trusted source that offers reliable, verifiable information to users.<br>
*  Information authenticity - information is primarily to be sourced from verifiable sources (primarily government or educational resources)
*  Users are to be able to indicate individual content relevance (likes & shares)
*  ??? User comments, actively moderated before publishing, may be permitted in a future release - however there is a risk of thereby introducing opinion-based content ???

### Financial_Planner site integrity -<br> 
The user is offered a tracking-free experience (errr check if this is actually a real possibility)
*  The user is guaranteed that their information will not be redistributed, re-used elsewhere or otherwise by the site owners or moderators.
*  The site owners apply appropriate methods to protect user registration information from hacking and security vulerabilities.
*  (FUTURE) In the future, the Financial_Planner site would dearly like to offer financial calculators into which users could enter some of their financial decisions and receive feedback and guidance..maybe about opportunities they could take at different life stages to improve their financial control for present & future needs..ideally as a game-based interface...but need to be cautious as, if users enter their financial details and save to a shared portal, will they then become vulnerable to someone hacking their information?
<br>     

### User Empowerment
A key objective of the Financial_Planner site is to make good-quality information readily available to users who wish to improve their financial awareness and decision-making.
That is, to empower users to become aware of financial dimensions of decision-making
Sites exist which are information-rich, however the information is 'buried' in a myriad of state portals.
In designing the site, then, particular emphasis is placed on accessibility, navigability and ability to retrieve relevant information.  In many cases, making <br>
<br>
<br>

### UX Design Scope User Requirements and Expectations
<br>
From the analysis of existing financial literacy/informational websites geared towards Ireland, a set of possible requirements was identified for a meta-portal which allows theme-based grouping of financial literacy resources.
<br>    

<ul>MVP Requirements:
<li>Must be intuitive to use</li>
<li>Must be easy to learn</li>
<li>Good for first time or returning users</li>
<li>Accessible - no ad display & no paywall</li>
<li>Easy visbility of financial themes</li>
<li> with ability to identify 'favourite' themes of interest and to hide themes not of interest (reading list?)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>Requirements - Desirable:
<li>Should have administrator portal which allow for:</li>
<li>  creation of themes/ catgories, with title and brief descriptor</li>
<li>  ability to add resources to a theme, by resource type (link / tool / article/ blog post/ video clip)</li>
<li> Ability to assign estimated reading time</li>
<li> ability to add one resoure to multiple themese?  Maybe using hashtags? </li>
  
From a **user perspective**, should-haves and nice to haves include: 
<li> Ability to filter content to just items/articles of interest</li>
<li> Distinguish between first time and returning user</li>
<li> Ability to browse annonymously and only create a profile once trust has been established </li>li>
<li> Guarantee of no ads or mis-use of information </li>
<li> cookie-free? </li>
<li> Ability to judge authenticity of informatio (possibly by upvotes?)</li>
<li> Ability to comment? </li>
<li> Ability to browse FAQ within a theme or topic? </li>

</details>
  
### Fonts Chosen
The website itself is designed to be fairly unobtrusive.  Article fonts were somewhat limited with the standard range of Summernote (Article content creator) fonts, the best of the options seemed to be Arial 16.

### Colour Scheme 
Again, designed to be fairly unobtrusive and not to draw attention to the background.  The articles themselves contain a colourful image and content may include images.  A green background colour and a default green-money logo have been used where possible on the site.

### Design Images

### Design Images - Icons and Symbols

Consistent icons and symbols are used throughout the site, and in multiple contexts - e.g. Certain icons for likes, bookmarks, tasks, and responses (comments) appear in both a user and an article context.  These are descibed more fully within the features section.

## Agile
An Agile approach was followed in plannning this project.  This is somewhat in contrast to the developer's well-practised 'waterfall' habits and presented both a challenge and an opportunity to think in a different way about deliverables and incremental delivery.
It was helpful that the developer participated in a hackathon during Sept 2023, and had an opportunity to observe experienced Agile developers, and their use of Github issue tracking in a team environment.
This led to a much clearer understanding of User story and task breakdown, as well as how github can be tailored  to add value, rather than overhead(!), to programming work.
* One precept which was difficult to master was respecting the timeboxing of each iteration.  Attempts to 'just finish' a task by extending the iteration by a day or two, needed to be curbed.  Instead, I had to (will have to) train myself to end the sprint, then assess which work had been completed or not.
* Story points present another challenge.  A very natural interpretation of story points is to assign them a time value (rather than an 'effort' value).  So, at the outset, the most natural approach felt like assigning each task an estimated duration, and reflecting on story points as hours.  This allowed me to capacity plan the first couple of sprints/ iterations based on the time I had available..... I await to see if I will continue this as the project progresses, or whether I move to a more fluid interpretation of SPs.
* However with the magic law of time (better check what magic law this is) creative tasks in which I am fully engaged make the time fly, meaning I can spend quite a bit of elapsed time but without feeling the strain, whereas less desirable tasks cause time to drag!  <- how does this reflect story points?
* Agile representation using github tools

   
### Project
A github project was created within the Financial_Planner repo.  At a high level the project details are very simple really just a name and description.
<details><summary>GitHub Project Setup</summary>
<img src="./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-overview-of-project2.png">
</details>


### Issue Template
<details><summary>Issue template - User Story</summary>
<img src="./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-issues-template.png">
</details>
    
At the outset, an issue template was created specifically for user stories.  This holds 5 sections:  
* EPIC:  The parent functional theme for this user story
* A statement of what is to be achieved in the format 'As a **role** I want to **action** to achieve **goal**'.
* Assumptions made when creating this isssue (e.g. pre-requisites)
* Acceptance Criteria: List of conditions to demonstrate the issue has been satisfied/resolved
* Tasks:  Checkbox-marked list of tasks to address this user story.

Mid-way through the project, I created a template to capture project bugs to facilitate separate tracking/reporting.
I found this useful for 'larger' bugs although I maintained an issue logging spreadsheet for the project, and logged almost 70 issues in the 6 or so weeks of development.


### Project Issues
Issues were created to track planned end-to-end work in Financial_Planner, using the issue template for consistent appearance and content.   
Financial_Planner project scope includes UX design tasks, agile project setup, development tasks, documentation,  and testing.
<details><summary>Example issue - user story</summary>
<img src="./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-issue-example-user-story.png">
</details>

Some of the issues created were in fact tasks, which underpinned several user stories:
<details><summary>Example issue - task</summary>
<img src="./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-issue-example-task.png">
</details>


### EPICs
An epic in agile is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories, which are represented as github Issues.
The Financial_Planner project uses custom fields to hold the epic name, some initial high-level epics:  Agile, UX, Docs, MVP.
For clarity EPIC is also listed at the top of each issue.
<details><summary>EPICs</summary>
<img src="./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-epics.png">
</details>


### MoSCoW prioritisation
For prioritising user stories and known tasks, I assigned a label to each issue, one of:
* Must-have
* Should-have
* Could-have (or nice-to-have)
* Won't have (perhaps its a never, or perhaps this just means 'not at this release')
To make selection easier (ensure that these appeared at top of label list in the order above) I preceded each label with a number as shown:
<details><summary>MoSCow labels</summary>
<img src="./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-issues-moscow-prioritization.png">
</details>


### Story Points
Story points are intended as a 'level of required effort' measure.  I used a custom issue category field to represent these. 
While at the beginning it was easiest to think of story points in terms of 'hours', as the sprints passed it became easier to assess relative to work already completed.
An observation would be that interpreting story points as 'hours' is somewhat one-dimensional, as sometimes the elapsed hours can be greater or lesser depending on mood, state of flow etc.


### Milestones
While this is a relatively short project (developed over 2 months duration), there was sufficient opportunity to set milestones for MVP (mostly consisting of must-have issues) and releases.
The use of MVP milestone encouraged a 'deploy-early' mindset whereby the software could be delivered incrementally, with successive releases building on proven, working software.  
When creating the milestone a due date is needed, initially I set a due date of 3 weeks prior to deadline for MVP, with additional release dates scheduled up to the project deadline.

This approach ensured, it would be possible to deliver a working, functional system, even if difficulties were encountered with implementing some of the 'could-have' features..
<details><summary>Milestones</summary>
<img src="./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-milestones.png">
</details>

### Sprints and Iterations
In Agile methodology, effort is timeboxed into Srints, with a kickoff at the start of each Sprint time period, in which items from the product backlog are made ready for work (groomed) by ensuring all the details are completed on the user-story/issue card (task details, acceptance criteria, priority, dependencies, Story Point estimate ) before a developer starts working on it.  At the end of a sprint a retrospective should be undertaken to determine what worked well or not during that sprint.
For Financial_Planner a time-period of weekly sprints was chosen.  Loosely (given that the developer consisted of a one-person team), the sprint ran from Monday-Sunday inclusive, and the aim was to complete certain agreed user stories during a particular sprint.

<details><summary>Sprints/ github Iterations</summary>
<img src="./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-sprint-iteration-weekly.png">
</details>

Initially when performing the design tasks (effectively the first four sprints), the timeboxing aspects were not fully respected.
However from sprint5 onwards (the first programming sprint), it became easier to decide clearly what was to be included at the outset of each sprint, and to pull specific issues from the backlog and ensure that they were progressed during the planned sprint. 
I started doing formal sprint reviews with burndown charts, at end of:
[Sprint 5 retrospective]([Issue #24](https://github.com/DeeMcCart/CI_PP4_Financial_Planner/issues/24 target="_blank") )

[Sprint 6 retrospective]([Issue #33](https://github.com/DeeMcCart/CI_PP4_Financial_Planner/issues/33 target="_blank") )

[Sprint 7 retrospective]([Issue #35](https://github.com/DeeMcCart/CI_PP4_Financial_Planner/issues/35 target="_blank") )

[Sprint 8 retrospective]([Issue #47](https://github.com/DeeMcCart/CI_PP4_Financial_Planner/issues/47 target="_blank") )

As each weekly sprint progressed, I became more fluent with the insights/ burndown charts and started to develop to include actual time logged, a useful metric


### Issue Lifeycle
An issue is set to progress through a number of stages, each represented by a status during its lifecycle.  
Issues progressed through:
* Backlog 
* To-do
* In-progress
* Review
* Done


### Tabular Projects View
The tabular view of projects was very useful at the backlog grooming stage, as it shows open issues, and gives easy visiblity of associated fields, e.g. story points, epic, assigned sprint, etc 
<details><summary>Projects - Tabular view</summary>
<img src="./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-overview-of-project.png">
</details>

<details><summary>Projects - Tabular view2</summary>
<img src="./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-issues-tabular-view.png">
</details>

    
### Kanban board
Within a sprint, the kanban board provides invaluable visual tracking.  
In the Financial_Planner kanban board, issues progress from leftmost column (backlog) to rightmost (done)
Note that each column holds a descriptor to tell you what is happening to issues within the column.
<details><summary>Projects - Kanban (simple)</summary>
<img src="./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-issues-kanban-view.png">
</details>

An improved kanban view (developed mid-way through the project) is shown here, note that this shows:
* the number of issues at each kanban board state (e.g. highlighted in blue for InProgress column)
* The storypoints for each individual issue, as well as the total storypoints at each lifecycle status (e.g. highlighted in green for 'Todo' column)
* The EPIC associated with each issue (e.g. highlighted in pink within the 'Done' column)

![Projects - Rich Kanban board](./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/agile-issues-kanban-view-sp-epic-num-issues-per-col.png?raw=true "Improved kanban board with lots of information")

 
### Agile Observations and learnings
* Observation from hackathon - short user story names are best for visibility and tracking
* Observation from hackathon - a user story is generally a fairly big block with a number of subtasks.  It is not advisable to have an entire user story which is longer than a sprint, as it will be carried forward in the 'to do' or 'in progress' bucket without clear visibility.  Therefore likely to try breaking a complex user story into sub-stories/tasks.  Both the user story and the sub tasks will be listed as issues, the user story will remain in the 'to do' bucket after grooming, and its tasks will be ticked off when their individual issues are completed.  The individual issues will move through the kanban board lifecycle of backlog -> to do -> in progress -> review -> done.  The 'parent' user story will remain at 'to do' (or possibly 'in progress'???)
* Observation from hackathon - when merging of PR (pull requests) was performed in a distributed development environment, it was possible to link the PR to a kanban issue, and to automatically update the issue status based on the PR.   I would be interested in exploring how ths might be done for a solo developr (possibly workflows?)
* Observation - if I reference the issue # on a commit (but must be in the format #8 ) then I can hyperlink from that commit message back to the relevant user story or issue.
* Use of EPIC as a label rather than as an issue - this was an early decision, although when reviewing our cohort leader Alan Bushell's PP4 project, he showed how he had used Issues within Github to represent EPICS.  This seemed to work really well as it was possible to demonstrate a hierarchy of EPIC -> issues by including a link to the sub-issues within the EPIC 'issue' body.  Thus it was possible to click on the issues within the EPIC, check their status, then return to the EPIC.
At the time of seeing this I had already committed to using labels to represent EPICs, so I stayed with my original approach just to see how it would work in practice.
* Use of a public project repo - I made the repo public early on, as I had assumed this was needed for assessment.  And about half way through I was surprised to see some comments on my tasks from another (unknown) github user offering assistance with development - kind of like an open source approach.  So they had commented on a couple of tasks.  I kept the repo public, but changed the settings so that only users who had previously committed to the repo could comment, and I blocked that particular user from the workspace....

## Features 
Implemented features are fully documented in the Features readme, located at  

### Features in Scope 

<a href="https://github.com/DeeMcCart/CI_PP4_Financial_Planner/blob/main/README_Features.md" target="_blank">Site features</a>

It was helpful to create this as a separate document, as it is also offered to users as a 'how to' guide.

### Implementation Decisions
This project was somewhat unusual for me as I followed the Agile principle of not defining every feature fully at the start of a 8-week project process.  Instead, the project evolved and took its own shape over the duration.  I followed a principle of incremental delivery, deployed early and established the core structures pretty much as per the walkthrough training given.
<br>  
Some of the site ideas and features needed only really became clear as I played with the site as it was delivered, and experienced frustration or spotted opportunites or elements that were worth adding. So the site grew organically as time went on.
<br>
And it would still be growing organically if I didn't have a project dealine to submit (sometimes deadlines are really useful!!!)

### Features Left to Implement

#### F18 Write a custom app for Admin Console (FUTURE)
The FinancialPlanner site as delivered is a good base site with strong core functionality in the areas of content and task management. It has a decent front-end and is depends strongly on a standard Django Admin console in the backend.  However, as the site has incrementally developed, the database model complexity has increase, so there are a number of tables which need to be manually synchrnised, for example articles vs structured search tags, these are maintained separately and require some overhead to ensure they remain well-designed and consistent.
So this site would definitely benefit from a well-designed admin console to simplify the database maintanance overhead

#### F19 Content Creation (ONGOING & FUTURE)
Development of the site has required considerable programming effort however to really make it flourish, well-designed, appropriate content is needed.  There is huge scope for worksheets, budgeting lists, and many other tools to be created and made available to users.  This is where the real site benefit lies, in practical, relevant content that is easily understood and convertible into actionable tasks.

#### F20 Gamification (DEFINITELY FUTURE)
One of the original hopes for this site was to include a 'Game of Life' concept whereby a user could start with a notional financial health rating then take decisions and see the financial impact.  This is effectively a financial modelling exercise, the concept of a 'game' makes it less threatening to users, whereas, it could in fact act as a simulation providing 'what if' financial implications of life decisions.

#### F21 Structured/Lifestage search (NEAR-FUTURE)
The use of the structured article tags to provide a lifestage search feature has been designed and is operational in the backend, but doesnt yet have a front end implementation. This is a key feature as it would allow much more granular content filtering and greatly assist users by filtering down to just articles aligned with the user's needs e.g. 'I want to.... get a mortgage', 'I want to.... move to Ireland', 'I want to.... plan for later life' 

#### F22 UX and Integration features
Would like a 'share' button on articles and the ability to connect to whatsapp and other social media portals.
Would like to be able to send email notification for password reminders.
Would like to improve appearance of task and response windows, they are functional now but could be more beautiful.

#### Other features to be identified via target-user interaction
There are lots of other features which could be useful.  The version of FinancialPlanner delivered today is really a proof-of-concept and ideally it would now be exposed to a wider group of potential users, and based on their feedback and real-life needs, a development road map coud be established.  In the absence of an app to show, it has been difficult to have the 'what would you like in a financial literacy app?' discussion with potential users, but the FinancialPlanner app as-is is fine for demo and discussion purposes.
I would hope to develop FinancialPlanner further as a commercial app.

## Validation 

### HTML Validation 
- HTML
HTML validation was performed for the various site pages as follows:  Render the page via the app, right click on the page contents and take option to copy (rendered) source.  Paste this into a file and subject that file to the W3C validator.  

  - All errors returned from the validator were pursued and resolved.  Examples are shown below:
 
  on the index html pages when checked in the W3C validator:

![W3C Validator - index page](./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/validation-w3c-index-html.png?raw=true "W3C validator (index page)")


![W3C validator - my_planner page](./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/validation-w3c-myplanner-html.png?raw=true "W3C validator (my planner page)")

![W3C validator - my_actions page](./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/validation-w3c-myactions-html.png?raw=true "W3C validator (my actions page)") 

![W3C validator - my_user page](./django_financial_planner/docs/readme_images/validation-w3c-myuser-html.png?raw=true "W3C validator (my actions page)") 

### CSS Validation

No errors returned when passing through the official Jigsaw validator.

There are a number of smaller responsiveness issues still open at the time of writing (icon alignment on mobile phone)


## Deployment
<br>
* The site architecture requires git, Cloudinary, ElephantSQL to support PostGres database, Heroku and is therefore more complex.

 
 #### Install the Django environment in a workspace created with the CI template:
The steps to setup from scratch  are as follows:
 - pip3 install 'django<4'gunicorn (installs Django 3.2)
- pip3 install dj-database-url===0.5.0 psycopg2
- pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
- pip3 install urllib==1.26.15
- pip3 freeze --locaL>requirements.txt
- django-admin startproject django_financial_planner
- python3 manage.py startapp fp_blog (creates new app in project)
- settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [..'appname'...]
- python3 manage.py migrate (migrate changes)
- python3 manage.py runserver (1st run of server to test)
- settings.py ALLOWED_HOSts = [...'8000-address'..]

If installation to a fresh (non code institute) environment:
- From the GitHub repo, take the 'Code' button
- in your IDE:
- git clone 'pasted link from above'
- (if applicable) ensure you cd into the project folder  
- pip install requirements.txt
- ... check port 8000, will fail on invalid HOSTNAME
- Add the identified HOSTNAME into the ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES section of settings.py
- Add it also into CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS section
 
##### Create a new external database:

- ElephantSQL - setup a/c if needed
- create a new instance
- Click on created database and copy URL

#### Create the Heroku app:

- login to Heroku
- create a new app
- In settings tab, reveal cofig vars and add newDATABASE_URL = save link

#### Attach the database:

In dev environment root dir add env.py
import os
os.environ['DATABASE_URL']=['pasted URL from elephant']
os.environ['SECRET_KEY']='some key"

Add secret key to Heroku config vars

#### Prepare environment and settings.py file
settings.py:  
if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env
SECRET_KEY = os.eviron.get(SECRET_KEY)
DATABASES = {'default':dj-database-url,parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}
Save all files and migrate

#### Get our static and media files stored on Cloudinary

Create cloudinary account (if not already done)
Pickup the API config variable from the cloudinary dashboard
env.py:
add os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]="urlpath"

Heroku: add CLOUDINARY_RL to config vars
add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC (for testing phase only)

settings.py: Add Cloudinary to installeed apps
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary-storage.storage.staticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS
STATIC_ROOT
MEDIA_URL
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
BASEDIR..... TEMPLATES_DIR
TEMPLATES
ALLOWED_HOSTS

create the following root-level folders: media, static, template

Create a procfile (process file)
commit
From Heroku panel, deploy from main & test.

#### Crack on with development
Thereafter you are into building models, forms, templates etc

### Deploy to Heroku
If you wish the site CSS to be picked up by Heroku (it is possible to deploy without this, and the functionality will be loaded to Heroku app & database can be tested  -but the apperance will not be good)
but anyway when you want to check appearance
settings.py
DEBUG = False
Heroku
remove the config var for static files 


#### To re-deploy
Can set automatic redeployment in Heroku, this will refresh the app at every commit - useful for consistency checks

#### To fork the repository:
- Go to the GitHub repository
- Click on Fork button in the upper right hand corner

* To clone the repository:
- Go to the GitHub repository
- Locate the Coe button above the list of files and click it
- Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or Github CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to you clipboard
- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
- Type git clone and paste the URL from the clipboard($ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY)
- Press Enter to create your local clone
