I've always had a love of tech and, after drifting through college in my late teens, found my niche in assembling systems to closely match real-world problems.&nbsp; I discovered a love of learning and hold numerous academic and vocational qualifications.&nbsp; My work took me around the world (in the early years); for the last 20 years I've been lucky enough to work close to where I live in the beautiful counties of Wicklow and Carlow in the south-east of Ireland.</p><p>Aligned with my professional life is my personal story.&nbsp; I've been a single parent for many years, and I'm a cancer survivor.&nbsp; I maintained a middle-income career alongside raising my two sons; this gave me some workplace flexibility but constrained our income.&nbsp;</p><p>My experience of the 'squeezed middle', was earning above social security assistance thresholds, but needing to budget tightly to keep our family stable.&nbsp; My forensic-level focus on finances are a bit of a family joke.&nbsp; But, it meant that, even with scarce resources, as a family, we were able to survive and thrive.&nbsp; And take family holidays and make experiences together (thankfully, I quite enjoy camping!!)</p><p>My wish is to create a portal which will <b>empower </b>people....</p><p>by highlighting resources to help with financial planning....&nbsp;</p><p>ENJOY!!&nbsp;

The movie highlights the difficulties that women experience navigating this part of the financial world, which is male-dominated and not particularly welcoming towards female entrepreneurs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Women are required to engage with non-vaue-add 'prove-yourself' processes.&nbsp; 'We don't want charity, we want parity!' runs the theme tune.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Dapper Boi is a gender-neutral clothing range which includes jeans with practical deep pockets, shirts with additional between-button fasteners to avoid the 'chest gap' often experienced by women with button-front garments.&nbsp; As its founder, xxxx, says - we designed these garments with women in mind, but then guys approached us and said 'hey I too have butt cheeks, I want to wear your jeans'.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Pocket Sun started an investement company in her mid-20s.&nbsp; Initially the financial institutions she dealt with were sceptical of her youth and inexperience, but she now handles XXXXX funds and points out that the investment metric returns most when a company is pre-public, that women are a strong investment as they tend to employ capital wisely and XXXXXly (using the money in imaginative ways to overcome obstacles).</p><p>XXXX is a post-mastectomy lingerie company, the founder, XXXXX talked about her grandmothers life after breast cancer, watching her shopping for mastectomy-friendly underclothes, relegated&nbsp;to sterile aisles of chemist and pharmacies, 'next to the adult diapers'.&nbsp; XXXX shows the beautiful clothing, and demonstrates skintone-matching mastectomy forms.</p><p>Dennys is a large restaurant chain across the USA,&nbsp; it operates as a franchise model.&nbsp; &nbsp;The largest female franchisee is XXXXX, a glamorous entrepreneur who tells her heartwrenching journey 'I came from nothing.&nbsp; At 17 years old, I started front-of-house but then realised the waitresses were the ones making all the money.&nbsp; I begged my manager to let me work as a waitress'.&nbsp; At the time of making the movie (c. 2022) she owned XX franchises.</p><p>XXXX has now become an investor.&nbsp; We heard her views from the investment perspective, as well as 4 other investors.&nbsp; What they had in common was a clear sense of their own purpose, what they were willing to invest in, and the sought clarity of purpose from their clients.&nbsp; 'Nothing bad comes when women have more money'.</p><p>An important part of the 'Show Her the Money' movie roadshow is the panel discussion which follows.&nbsp; The film-maker and investor, Catherine Gray explains her motivation in touring to 50 locations with the movie..... The panel in Dublin consisted of an additional 5 international female entrepreneurs.&nbsp; They talked of their successes, the obstacles they'd to overcome in personal and professional life, and how they had built their empires, sorry businesses....&nbsp;</p><p>XXXX launched her auyverdic skincare range in the Indian market.&nbsp; Again there was a nod to her female lineage, with her mother making skincare products at home as she grew up.</p><p>The funny thing about this movie was that we saw the personal and family situation of each of the founders.&nbsp; Each had a family, children, and a network they were socially responsible for.&nbsp; The warmth of those relationships and the emotional journeys juxtapositioned with business activity was unusual to see.&nbsp; Corporate success is often portrayed for women as dual (didactic or whatever the word is) where family life is one slio and business life in another.&nbsp; Here we saw the intermingling of both which looked like a much more ecological natural flow.</p><p>An unspoken message was that entrepreneurial journeys, particularly when undertaken with a supportive partner, can combine family and professional lives, perhaps in a way that the corporate journey struggles with.&nbsp; Women in corporate roles are often required to 'mask' their family lives, to pretend not to have responsibilities and committments outside work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Coming full circle, I was delighted to see one attendee in Dublin with her daughter, and another with a younger child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "featured_image": "image/upload/placeholder", "excerpt": "", "created_on": "2024-05-26T08:31:38.288Z", "updated_on": "2024-05-26T08:31:38.288Z", "status": 0, "likes": [], "favourites": []}}, {"model": "fp_blog.article", "pk": 25, "fields": {"title": "Economic Abuse", "slug": "economic-abuse", "author": 1, "content": "<p>ECONOMIC ABUSE</p><p>In the wanderings of my recent stakeholder-and-funding research I came across a charity (which is elegible for funding under the AIB Community award scheme.&nbsp;
